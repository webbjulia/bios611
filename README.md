Hi, this is my 611 Data Science Project. More to come.

This project will explore the public dataset "Breast Cancer Proteomes" from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piotrgrabo/breastcancerproteomes/data) , which features proteome profiling of 77 breast cancer patients.

The source data consist of three files: 77_cancer_proteomes_CPTAC_itraq.csv, clinical_data_breast_cancer.csv, and PAM50_proteins.csv.
